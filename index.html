    Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian entrepreneur who initially manufactured tractors. His passion for automobiles, particularly high-performance sports cars, led him to create a brand that would rival established manufacturers like Ferrari. The company's first model, the Lamborghini 350 GT, debuted in 1964 and was an instant success. With its striking design and powerful V12 engine, the 350 GT set the tone for Lamborghini's future, emphasizing luxury and performance. Over the years, Lamborghini has produced numerous iconic models that have solidified its reputation as one of the premier luxury sports car manufacturers in the world.
